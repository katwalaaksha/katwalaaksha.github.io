				<u><h3>Aksha katwala</h3></u>
I am 17 years old girl with a lot of dreams. I am a student of polytechnic MSU and studying in third year of diploma in field Computer Engineering.
I like to explore new things. 
				
I am also good at hand work and embroidery work. Most of the people thinks that higher studies are not meant for girls as they have to become a housewife,
but i does not agree with this and my parents also supports me. I wish to become a Computer Engineer.
				
I believe that with hard work we can achieve anything so never stop dreaming.
I have learnt languages like C,C++,SQL,JAVA,PYTHON.
